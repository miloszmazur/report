\section{Thesis Goal}
The main goal of the thesis is to answer the question:
%``Can we teach artificial agents to cooperate by forcibly putting them in conflicting situations?'' 
``How cooperative behaviors between artificial agents influence the performance in multi-agent task-oriented environments?''
\section{Thesis Research Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide a platform that can be used to automatically generate and evaluate artificial agents.
    \item Measure and find a way to deal with the impact of the initial generation.   \item Measure the effect cooperative behaviors had on task execution.
\end{itemize}
\section{Thesis Structure Overview}
In order to provide the answer to a question stated in the thesis goal, Chapter 2 will first provide essential background information on technologies used in the thesis. Chapter 3 will acquaint the reader with the platform the research was done on, as well as the map used in specimen evaluation. Following that, Chapter 4 contains detailed description of research conditions, restraints put on the environment and actually combining the two technologies described in background chapters before. The last chapter presents the details of experiments done as part of the thesis, as well as their results.

The attempt to answer the question is then presented in conclusion, along with ideas for possible future research.
